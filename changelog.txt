Isle of Mists

v1.0.4.18:
--> IoM: officially mainlined as of 1.15.14 (Yay, me!)

v1.0.4.17:
--> adjusted to match settings to the one of the PR

v1.0.4.16:
--> XP modifier adjusted to 80% (original was 100%)
    From my latest playthrough, I have noticed that players might not
    be able to accumulate enough XP in time for the final waves so I 
    am lowering the XP modifier. I am also willing to go as far as 70%, no lower.

v1.0.4.15:
--> final waves appear 2-3 turns after each other instead of 1-2

v1.0.4.14:
--> nerfed one of the final waves
--> adjusted balance

v1.0.4.12:
--> fixed a lua error

v1.0.4.11:
--> adjusted enemy wave strength
    (if this is too easy now, I guess I gotta start upping difficulty now)

v1.0.4.10:
--> adjusted the spawner's unit amount formulae to ensure waves do overwhelm the players
    should be 4-5 units per wave
--> solitaire mode start gold bonus nerfed to 25 (from 50).
--> disallowed swimmer units from 1 MP cost on flat.
--> made it a requirement to have the scenario installed for both players
--> interval of enemy waves widened by 1 turn.

v1.0.4.9:
--> Swapped out Jinn for Wraith. Jinn was too much LMAO. I seriously think this unit is completely messed up in terms of balance. Satan would be proud to see such a unit.

v1.0.4.8:
--> reverted the village gold buff (made it too easy)

v1.0.4.7
--> IoM: slightly buffed player side(s) (village_gold has now been doubled)
--> IoM: (solitaire mode) +50 starting gold

v1.0.4.6
--> IoM: fixed deprecated lua code warning

v1.0.4.5
--> IoM: fixed anomalous bug

v1.0.4.4
--> IoM: fixed an incorrect unit ID bug
--> readjusted difficulty again

v1.0.4.2
--> IoM:
    --> reduced difficulty of waves so that the scenario is at least passable and not impossible.

    --> Final waves spawn 2-3 turns after one another
    --> regular waves split into 2.
    --> Slider adjusted to +/- 15 increments

v1.0.3
--> 2p - Isle of Mists
    --> Assigned the "mainline candidate" status
    --> Side 5 healer unit appropriately nerfed
        (after someone used her as a meat shield)
    --> slight adjustment to one enemy wave
    --> Revised one of the final waves
    --> slight code adjustments (Lua)
    --> void border fix for maps
    --> new weather change - second rain/inundation
    --> starting gold buffed to 100 (since it's too hard now)
        --> I was able to clear on 2 player mode,
            if it seems easy, I might restore the 75g start amount
--> 2p - Dark Forecast (revision)
    --> slight code adjustments (Lua)
        --> Fixed enemies moving over impassable/unwalkable terrain
    --> adjusted one of the final waves
    --> slight adjustment to one enemy wave

v1.0.2
--> Dark Forecast, Isle of Mists (both):
    --> Added 3 more harder difficulty scales
        to compensate for the enemy strength
        dropping in 1-player mode if on +30% difficulty scaling.

--> added a check to only load WoL variations
    if WoL is installed.
